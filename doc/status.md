## Technical Debt
1. Mock data needs to be replaced with real API calls
2. Error handling needs to be implemented
3. Loading states need to be added
4. Form validation needs to be enhanced
5. Type definitions need to be completed

## Next Steps
1. Complete Supabase integration
2. Implement real authentication
3. Set up testing framework
4. Add error boundaries
5. Implement data persistence

## Risks

2. Performance with real data
3. Testing coverage
4. App store approval process

## Timeline
- Current Phase: UI Implementation
- Next Milestone: Backend Integration
- Expected Completion: TBD
