# CampusConnect Project Status

## Current Progress (As of Current Date)

### Completed Features ‚úì
1. **Project Setup**
   - React Native (Expo) project structure
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Navigation framework
   - Base UI components

2. **UI Implementation**
   - Authentication screens (Login/Register)
   - Profile screens (EditProfile, Settings)
   - College exploration interface
   - Verification flow
   - Settings management
   - Avatar/photo upload capability

3. **Core Components**
   - Navigation system
   - Theme implementation
   - Linear Gradient for UI effects
   - Camera integration
   - Safe Area handling
   - Icon system (MaterialCommunityIcons)

### In Progress üöß
1. **Backend Integration**
   - Supabase migrations are set up but need implementation
   - Authentication system needs real integration
   - Database schema is defined but needs connection

2. **Feature Implementation**
   - Media handling (partial implementation)
   - User verification system (UI ready, backend pending)
   - Profile management (UI ready, backend pending)

### Pending Tasks ‚è≥
1. **Backend Features**
   - Complete Supabase integration
   - Real authentication implementation
   - File storage setup
   - Real-time updates

2. **Testing**
   - No testing implementation yet
   - Need to set up Jest configuration
   - Need to add component tests
   - Integration tests required

3. **Data Management**
   - Need to implement data persistence
   - State management implementation required
   - API integration pending
   - Offline capabilities needed

## Technical Debt
1. Mock data needs to be replaced with real API calls
2. Error handling needs to be implemented
3. Loading states need to be added
4. Form validation needs to be enhanced
5. Type definitions need to be completed
6. Environment configuration needed for Supabase

## Next Steps
1. Complete Supabase integration
2. Implement real authentication
3. Set up testing framework
4. Add error boundaries
5. Implement data persistence

## Risks
1. Backend integration complexity
2. Testing coverage
3. Data persistence implementation
4. Security implementation for user data

## Timeline
- Current Phase: UI Implementation & Backend Setup
- Next Milestone: Supabase Integration
- Expected Completion: TBD

## Directory Structure Status
- Assets: ‚úì Complete
- Screens: ‚úì Basic UI Complete
- Lib: üöß In Progress
- Supabase: üöß Migrations Ready
- Documentation: ‚úì Well Maintained
